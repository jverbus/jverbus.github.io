I'm happy to announce that my implementation of the isolation forest unsupervised outlier detection algorithm was open sourced today.
It is used by the LinkedIn Anti-Abuse AI team to detect and prevent abusive activity on the world's largest professional network.

You can read more about isolation forests, my Scala/Spark implementation, how it solves challenges unique to anti-abuse work, and many other potential uses for this algorithm on the [LinkedIn Engineering Blog](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2019/isolation-forest).
The repository is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/linkedin/isolation-forest) and artifacts are available on [Bintray](https://bintray.com/linkedin/maven/isolation-forest).
Artifacts are also published to JCenter.
