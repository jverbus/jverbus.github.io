I recently gave a 2.5-hour hands-on workshop on Large Language Models (LLMs) at the 2025 AI Winter School, hosted by the Center for the Fundamental Physics of the Universe at Brown University. This session focused on setting up an LLM with both the OpenAI API and an open LLaMA model, as well as building a basic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to demonstrate how researchers can leverage specialized, domain-specific information about their research when using LLMs.

During the workshop, participants worked hands-on with both API-based and locally hosted models. They left with practical insights into how to integrate LLMs and RAG into specialized research and engineering tasks, particularly those involving quantitative or highly technical data.
