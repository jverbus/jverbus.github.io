Last year, the LinkedIn Anti-Abuse team published developed a simple, novel approach that can detect 99.6% of StyleGAN-generated profile photos and published our first paper on AI image detection ([more detail]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2023-06-20-detecting-ai-generated-profile-photos.md %})). 

In the almost one year since we released our first paper, this field of study and our own research remain dynamic and fast paced. We are excited to share our latest research paper titled Finding AI-Generated Faces in the Wild, where we introduce a new concept for a model that can detect AI-generated images produced by a variety of different generative algorithms. This new concept can tell the difference between real profile photos and those generated by different types of AI models, such as generative-adversarial-network-based StyleGANs, generated.photos and EG3d, and diffusion-based Stable Diffusion, DALL-E 2, and Midjourney.

Our approach is detailed in the full paper that was released at the [Workshop on Media Forensics](https://sites.google.com/view/wmf2024/home) at the 2024 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) on June 18th 2024.
