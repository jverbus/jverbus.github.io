The LinkedIn Scholars program enables academics to contribute directly to LinkedInâ€™s vision of creating economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce.

LinkedIn Scholars has enabled the LinkedIn Trust Data team and University of California, Berkeley Professor Hany Farid to collaborate on new techniques for AI-generated image detection. This unique partnership enabled the creation of a novel approach for detecting a common type of AI-generated profile photos that is lightweight and highly effective.

This cutting-edge research helps LinkedIn continue to improve and increase the effectiveness of our automated anti-abuse defenses to help detect and remove fake accounts before they have a chance to reach our members and customers.

Our approach is detailed in the full paper that was released at the [Workshop on Media Forensics](https://sites.google.com/view/wmf2023/home) at the 2023 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) on June 18th 2023.
