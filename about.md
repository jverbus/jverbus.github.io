## Profile

I'm a **Senior Staff Software Engineer at LinkedIn**, where I work on **AI for Trust** (e.g., fake accounts, coordinated abuse, and GenAI content integrity).

I created and maintain [isolation-forest](https://github.com/linkedin/isolation-forest), an open-source anomaly detection library used across LinkedIn anti-abuse systems.

## Current focus

- Trust and safety systems for large online platforms
- Practical machine learning for adversarial environments
- Applied research connecting model performance to product impact

## Background

Before tech, I was an experimental particle physicist. I earned my PhD at Brown University on the LUX dark matter experiment, where I helped build and operate a leading-generation detector located a mile underground in the former Homestake gold mine in South Dakota.
