## About Me

I'm a Senior Staff Software Engineer at LinkedIn, working on AI for Trust (e.g., detecting fake accounts, automated bots, GenAI content). My work has led to multiple patents, research collaborations, and publications.

I created and maintain [isolation-forest](https://github.com/linkedin/isolation-forest), an open-source anomaly detection library used across LinkedIn’s anti-abuse systems.

Before tech, I was an experimental particle physicist. I earned my PhD at Brown University on the LUX dark matter experiment, where I helped build and operate a leading-generation detector located a mile underground in the former Homestake gold mine in South Dakota.
