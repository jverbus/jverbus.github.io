## About Me

I'm a Senior Staff Software Engineer at LinkedIn, where I lead AI work on trust and safety — detecting fake accounts, AI-generated profile photos, and abusive behavior at scale. I hold multiple patents in this space and have published at venues like CVPR in collaboration with academic researchers.

I also maintain [linkedin-isolation-forest](https://github.com/linkedin/isolation-forest), an open-source anomaly detection library used across LinkedIn's anti-abuse systems.

Before tech, I was an experimental particle physicist. I did my PhD at Brown University on the LUX dark matter experiment — building and operating the world's most sensitive dark matter detector, a mile underground in an abandoned South Dakota gold mine.
